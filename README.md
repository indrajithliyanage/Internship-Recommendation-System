# Sustainable System For Internship Placement Recommendation Of Sri Lankan IT Undergraduates

In this study, I used a technology stack consisting of ASP.NET, C#, jQuery, Bootstrap, and SQL to develop a recommendation system (Web App) for IT undergraduates in Sri Lanka. 

The system utilizes the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) methods to evaluate and rank internship companies based on 10 key parameters and provides recommendations to new users based on these rankings. 

The aim of the study was to provide a simple and effective solution for the high levels of stress and burnout experienced by IT interns in the country.
